# Diamond Price Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the price of diamonds based on various features. By utilizing a dataset of diamond attributes and corresponding prices, we will build a predictive model that can estimate diamond prices with reasonable accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of information about various diamonds, including their carat weight, cut quality, color, clarity, and other characteristics. Each diamond in the dataset is labeled with its corresponding price. The dataset will be used for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

The dataset used in this project can be found at [link to dataset].

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code and reproduce the results:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- [additional libraries]

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diamond-price-prediction.git
cd diamond-price-prediction
